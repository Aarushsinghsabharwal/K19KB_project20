		<li>Complaint Description:
		Rude behaviour of a government employee.<br>
		Recently I went to make a biometric update in my aadhar card. There while standing in a queue, I asked when my turn would come. The person sitting in front of me, Mr.Anuj Kumar replied rudely saying harsh words to me. He also threatened me that he would throw me out. This type of behaviour is not expected from a public servant. I put up a letter in the complaint box but it was of no use. Kindly help.

		<li>Aadhar Number: 2249 5672 9026</li>
		<li>Complaint Description:
		Lose traffic police control and disobey of traffic rules<br>
		Daily I go to my office by car. There everyday I get struck in traffic because some people do not obey the traffic rules, despite the fact that police is standing in front of them. Policemen only stand roadside, with a cup of tea in their hands, gossiping with each other. There is no law and order enforcement from their side. I wonder why are they getting paid for it. I have an audio file with me.
